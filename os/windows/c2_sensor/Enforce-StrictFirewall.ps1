.SYNOPSIS
    Enforces a strict Default Deny (Block) inbound Windows Firewall posture with binary state rollback.

.DESCRIPTION
    Safely transitions the Windows Defender Firewall to a strict 'Block Inbound' default.
    Generates a full binary export of the firewall state prior to mutation.
    Includes built-in validation to ensure pre-existing explicit 'Allow' rules continue to function.

.PARAMETER Rollback
    Switch. Triggers the restoration of a previous firewall state.

.PARAMETER BackupPath
    String. The absolute path to the .wfw backup file to restore (Required if -Rollback is used).

.EXAMPLE
    # Enforce strict policy (Auto-creates backup in C:\FirewallBackups)
    .\Enforce-StrictFirewall.ps1

.EXAMPLE
    # Rollback to a known good state
    .\Enforce-StrictFirewall.ps1 -Rollback -BackupPath "C:\FirewallBackups\FW_State_20260417_1300.wfw"

.NOTES
    Enforcing a strict "Default Deny" inbound firewall posture physically neutralizes an adversary's ability to
    establish listening posts or execute lateral movement across the network. By eliminating these quiet,
    peer-to-peer pathways, we force the attacker to rely exclusively on outbound beaconing to maintain command
    and control. Pairing this inbound lockdown with the ML-driven outbound C2 sensor creates a strategic,
    unavoidable chokepoint. We operate under the "Assume Breach" paradigm: by denying horizontal movement, we
    force the adversary's traffic vertically into our behavioral analytics engine, ensuring rapid, mathematical
    detection of evasive tradecraft.
